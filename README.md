## Q-Mixer

A rust library utilizing cpal and symphonia. The library acts as a mixer with unlimited inputs / outputs.

Q-Mixer is still in pre-alpha stage.
Parts of the code written with AI will be refactored once the library stablizes.

The goal of this library is to:
- Support DJ-like mixing with beat information and stems
- Handle realtime input with DSPs
